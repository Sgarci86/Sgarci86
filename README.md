### Hi there 👋

I'm Soraida, a PhD candidate at the University of Illinois, Chicago. My research focuses on understanding the decisions humans make when interacting with other humans, and the surrounding environment. To explore these complex systems, I use real world data and develop simulations using statistical and agent-based models to uncover the underlying factors driving these choices. With a strong background in statistics and R, I apply advanced statistical methods to analyze real life scenarios and explore data visualizations. Throughout my academic journey, I have expanded my skill set to learn Machine Learning tools and Python to gain better insights and make powerful predictions. Additionally, I am applying data extraction techniques such as web scraping from large datasets. I consider myself a Data Scientist, a career where I can integrate my expertise with the evolving field of AI. Being at the forefront of this technological movement excites me, as I have witnessed how it has developed throughout the years. Now I can look towards the future by contributing in innovative projects that are transforming the world. Once I attain a position after obtaining my degree, I will commit to mentor underrepresented students, providing them with the guidance and support needed to navigate through graduate school. Just as I found joy in acquiring new skills, I hope to inspire and equip the next generation with the knowledge and confidence to excel in their own careers.
