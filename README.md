### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Soraida, a PhD candidate at the University of Illinois, Chicago. My research focuses on understanding the decisions humans make when interacting with other humans, wildlife and the surrounding environment. To explore these complex systems, I use real world data and develop simulations using agent-based models to uncover the underlying factors driving these choices. With a strong background in statistics and R, I apply advanced statistical methods to analyze real life scenarios and visualize insights through exploratory data visualizations. Throughout my academic journey, I have expanded my skill set by learning additional programming languages such as Python, allowing me to implement techniques like web scraping to extract insights from large datasets. My experience in my program has lead me towards Data Science, a career where I can integrate my expertise with the evolving field of AI. Being at the forefront of this technological movement excites me, as I have witnessed how it has developed throughout the years. I'm excited for the future and am ready to contribute to innovative projects that are transforming the world. When I attain a position after obtaining my degree, I will commit to mentor underrepresented students, providing them with the guidance and support needed to navigate through graduate school. Just as I found joy in acquiring new skills, I hope to inspire and equip the next generation with the knowledge and confidence to excel in their own careers.
