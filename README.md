### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Soraida and I am currently a PhD student at the University of Illinois, Chicago researching human and wildlife interactions using simulation modeling. After pursuing a career in real estate investments, I decided to return to academia to follow my passion advocating for wildlife. I have held various internships including one at Argonne National Laboratories in which I assisted the Bureau of Land Management assessing environmental impacts of large scale solar paneling on public lands.  While applying to graduate school I volunteered at The Field Museum conducting research in the mammals collection department. My research experience lead me to be accepted to Purdue University in the Forestry and Natural Resources department and obtained a Masters in Science where I researched the human disturbances on the environment. In the future, I would like to volunteer my time and expertise at a non-profit organization that supports animal rights. I would also like to mentor underrepresented students so they have the proper guidance needed to navigate their way through graduate school.
